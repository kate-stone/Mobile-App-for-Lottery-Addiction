# Mobile App for Lottery Addiction

For most people playing the lottery is a fun and harmless activity. For some it becomes a habit which eventually leads to addiction. For these people, playing the lottery can lead to spending money they don't have and resorting to criminal activities to repay their debts. 

To address this, a medical institute that aims to prevent and treat gambling addictions wants to build a dedicated mobile app to help lottery addicts better estimate their chances of winning. Our role in the development will be to create the logical core of the app and calculate probabilities.

For the first version of the app, they want us to focus on the 6/49 lottery and build functions that enable users to answer questions like:

- What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?
- What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?
- What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?

The institute also wants us to consider historical data coming from the national 6/49 lottery game in Canada. The data set has data for 3,665 drawings, dating from 1982 to 2018. It is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datascienceai/lottery-dataset#649.csv). 

This project was completed as part of the "Probability: Fundamentals" course by [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/course/probability-fundamentals/).
